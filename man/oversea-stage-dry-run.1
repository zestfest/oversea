.SH NAME
oversea-stage-dry-run - Shows OverSea stage execution steps

.SH SYNOPSIS
oversea stage dry-run [--help] [--hide-state-steps] [--only-visible-steps]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Parses a OverSea stage and generates a detailed report showing all steps in order of execution.

This command can be used to understand what a stage will do, without actually
running the stage. For instance, it shows the total number of steps; the type
of each step,
either
.I Runner,
.I State,
or
.I Module;
in which minion each step will execute; and other relevant information.
