.SH DESCRIPTION
.B OverSea
is a collection of Salt files for deploying, managing and automating Ceph.  The goal is to provide the necessary tools for any Ceph service.  Besides the core functionality for monitors and osds, OverSea supports CephFS, RadosGW, iSCSI and Ganesha.  These Ceph features are managed in a series of Stages reflecting the life cycle of a Ceph cluster.
